You are dead. You see a long queue leading up to what you belief must be heaven’s gate. You get in line.
After a few minutes of waiting you reach the gate. Suddenly you hear loud sirens, balloons and confetti
rain from above.

The gate keeper says that you are the 6666th visitor today! As a reward you get to choose your reincarnation
form. Cool! You think for a moment and come to the conclusion that after an unhappy life as a math teacher
you want to be happy – so you decide to become a happy number!

But first you need to calculate a few happy numbers to choose from!

A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number
by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1, or it loops endlessly
in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while
those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. (from Wikipedia)

For example, 7 is happy, as the associated sequence is:
7^2 = 49
4^2 + 9^2 = 97
9^2 + 7^2 = 130
1^2 + 3^2 = 10
1^2 = 1

Interface To solve this exercise, implement the following interface after you checked out the project template
from below:

/**
 * Check if a number is a 'happy number'  
 *
 * @param number    number to be checked
 * @return          true if parameter is a happy number
 */
boolean isHappy(long number);
